## FizzBuzz

Build a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

- Write a function that takes no parameters
- The function should output the numbers 1 through 100, following the rules from above

*Notes*
- Iterate through every number from 1 to 100, starting from 1
- For each iteration, check the number
- If the number is a multiple of 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"
- If the number is a multiple of 3, print "Fizz"
- If the number is a multiple of 5, print "Buzz"
- If the number does not qualify for any of the above conditions, print the current number
- Finish iterating at 100
